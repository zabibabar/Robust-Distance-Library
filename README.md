# Robust-Distance-Library
R2obust Distance Library offers functions to calculate the shortest distance between multiple data structures. For the scope of the project the data structures are limited to point, edge, and polygon. The library is available in C# along with classes to instantiate points, edges, and polygons. Similar features are also available in Processing (a Java-based graphical library), but the input and output is provided through a display window by dragging and dropping points. 
It supports the following functions: 
1.	DistanceFromPointToPoint (Point p1, Point P2)
2.	DistanceFromPointToEdge (Point p, Edge e) 
3.	DistanceFromPointToPolygon (Point p, Polygon poly)
4.	DistanceFromEdgeToEdge (Edge e1, Edge e2)
5.	DistanceFromEdgeToPolygon (Edge e, Polygon poly)
6.	DistanceFromPolygonToPolygon (Polygon poly1, Polygon poly2)
7.	DistanceFromPolygonList (List<Polygon> poly)
